# Surgical Unit Simulation (Python + SimPy)

This project models the flow of patients through a **surgical unit** consisting of:
- Multiple **Preparation Rooms (P)**
- One **Operating Theatre (OR)**
- Multiple **Recovery Rooms (R)**

### Features
- Process-oriented **Discrete-Event Simulation** using SimPy  
- Configurable parameters (arrival rate, service times, number of rooms)  
- Interactive **Tkinter GUI** with live KPIs and plots  
- CSV result export for further analysis  

### How to Run
```bash
python src/gui_simple.py
